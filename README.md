# SpO2Bias
Sample data as well as codes used for simulation in paper *Bias in Pulse Oximetry Due to Signal-to-Noise Ratio*

The *.mat* file is the ISS Imagent dataset converted to Matlab format without any processing. The raw dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub.

The PTT dataset can be found here: https://physionet.org/content/pulse-transit-time-ppg/1.1.0/ Only the *.csv* formats of the "sit" tasks were used. We DO NOT own the copyright of the PTT dataset. Please refer to the licensing of the original authors.

If you have any questions, please contact Prof. Pulkit Grover (pgrover@andrew.cmu.edu) or Dr. Jiaming Cao (j.cao.2@bham.ac.uk)
